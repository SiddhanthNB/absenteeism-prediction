# absenteeism-project
Fitting a machine learning model on  employee's absenteeism in a business organization.

Problem: Factors like higher competitiveness, hard to achieve goals, risk of losing the job tend to create stress and anxiety in the employees working in the firm. Which will further develop into undesired illness and diseases, which may beÂ long-term or short-term illness resulting in absenteeism of the employees?

Task: We want to know for how many working hours an employee could be away from work based on information such as how far they live from workplace, how many family members they have, whether they have higher level eductaion degree and etc.
